    <h1>Welcome to Mr. Roboger's Neighborhood!</h1>
    <p>Mr. Roboger is a friendly robot who would love to talk to you! He only knows a few words and phrases though... and only if you speak to him first using numbers... so he's not the best conversationalist...... but........ he's still deserving of love!!!</p>
    <p>Give him a shout by entering a number between 1 and 100:</p>
    <form id="formID">
        <input type="number" placeholder="Enter a number">
    </form>
